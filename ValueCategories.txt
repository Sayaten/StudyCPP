has identity: it's possible to determine whether the expression refers to the same entity as another expression, 
			  such as by comparing addresses of the objects or functions they identify (obtained directly or indirectly)
can be moved from: move constructor, move assignment operator, 
				   or another function overload that implements move semantics can bind to the expression.

rvalue  : may or may not have identity and can be moved from are called rvalue ( prvalue or xvalue ) 
prvalue : do not have identity and can be moved from are called prvalue expressions
		  prvalue means pure rvalue
lvalue  : have identity and cannot be moved from are called lvalue expressions
glvalue : have identity and may or may not be moved from are called glvalue ( lvalue or xvalue )
		  glvalue means generalized lvalue
xvalue  : have identity and can be moved from are called xvalue expressions
